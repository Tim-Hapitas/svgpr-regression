# SVGPR: Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression

Tutorials and python implementation for performing Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression on large datasets.

## About

A python package for scalable Gaussian process regression, allowing for simultaneous inference of both a dataset's latent function and input-dependent noise profile. Originally developed for applications in data-driven Galactic Dynamics but is applicable to any large datset with heteroskedastic noise. This package acts as both a wrapper and extension to the GPyTorch package ().

## Status

* Under development! Installation instructions, code examples, full tutorials, and final citation information will be added following paper publication. 

## Citation

Based on the method presented in "Gaussian Process Methods for Very Large Astrometric Data Sets (Hapitas et al. 2025) - accepted for publication in ApJ.
